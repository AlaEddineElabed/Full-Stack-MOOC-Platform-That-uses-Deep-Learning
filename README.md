# Full-Stack-MOOC-Platform-That-uses-Deep-Learning
## Problematic
MOOC sites do not use the data collected to identify students who are at risk of dropping their courses.
## Objectif
Implementation and development of a deep neural network based application for learning management.
## Evaluation
Existing MOOC web applications do not contain predictive models for tracking student behavior.
## Proposed Solution
Platform to facilitate students' access to MOOC courses.
Predict individual probability of course dropout.
Facilitate instructor intervention for students at risk of dropping out.
